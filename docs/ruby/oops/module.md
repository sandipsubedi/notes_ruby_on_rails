### 2 main benefits of Modules
1. Grouping things together.
2. Makes mixins possible, thus removes the need for multiple inheritance.

- Modules are a way of grouping together methods, classes, and constants.
- Module constants are named just like class constants, with an initial uppercase letter.
- There are times when you want to group things together that don't naturally form a class. Use modules in those cases.
