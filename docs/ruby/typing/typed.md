### Statically Typed Language:
- Variable's type is static.
  ```java
  int count = 0;
  // Count will always be Integer.
  ```
- Statically typed languages are generally compiled language.

### Dynamically Typed Language:
- Variable's type can change.
- Typing is associated with the value of the variable rather than the variable itself.

```python
name = "John"
name = true
```

```rb
[59] pry(main)> name = "John"
=> "John"
[60] pry(main)> name = true
=> true
[61] pry(main)> name
=> true
```
