Documenting notes for Ruby on Rails.

I came from a Java background, and still do some Java coding. So I will be comparing a lot of practices and syntax with Java.

This documentation is work-in-progress. And, I will be adding more and more as we go.

- The Notes and examples are created on Ruby 2.6 and Rails 6.
- Most of the instructions related to installation is on a Mac.

### Features:
1. A lot of real life examples.
2. Links to other great articles.
